<h3> AQI Bot </h3>

<body> This is a Reddit bot that returns the Air Quality Index of any city given to it. </body>

<h4> How to Use </h4>

<body> (The bot is currently not online) To use the bot on Reddit, all you have to do is mention its name in your
comment, and then put the name
of the city whose AQI you want afterwards, in quotes. So to get the AQI for Beijing, you could write something like:
Calling on /u/aqi-bot "New Delhi" </body>

<body> The bot will then return the Air Quality Index, along with the date its accurate to, and its source. </body>

<h4> Disclaimer </h4>
<body> This bot is runs on PRAW, and gets its data from the World Air Quality Index project. It's only as good as its
data, so the bot may return out of date information if the data isn't there yet, and so be sure to check out what
date and time the info is accurate to, which will be included in aqi-bot's reply. </body
